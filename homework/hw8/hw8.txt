Homework #8

1. Constraints for Pr(D=yes|T=yes) >= 0.3:
Pr(D=yes) >= 0.08942
Pr(T=no|D=yes) >= 0.005966 (false positive)
Pr(T=yes|D=no) >= 0.002322 (false negative)

2.
a) Given LightSensor=On and DogBarking=No, the following instantiation was obtained:
ExpectingGuests: No
FamilyHome: No
OutdoorLight: On
LightSensor: On
Battery: OK
LightSensorHealth: OK
SoundSensor: Off
SoundSensorHealth: OK
DogBowelTrouble: Yes
DogOutside: Yes
DogBarking: No
HearableBarking: No

These values were obtained by using Query mode in Samiam and setting the posterior values for
LightSensor and DogBarking.

b) Given FamilyHome=Yes and ExpectingGuests=No:
LightSensor: Off
Battery: OK
LightSensorHealth: OK
SoundSensor: Off
SoundSensorHealth: OK

These values were obtained using the same method as 2a.

c) Adding Battery to Z will block the path LightSensor -> Battery -> SoundSensor
Adding FamilyHome to Z will block the path LightSensor -> OutdoorLight -> FamilyHome ->
DogOutside -> DogBarking -> HearableBarking -> SoundSensor

Therefore, Z = {Battery, FamilyHome} because LightSensor and SoundSensor are d-separated so
they are independent given Z.

d) This network is a multiply-connected network.
